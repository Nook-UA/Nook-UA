## Retrospective

We managed to finish the mobile application with success, although some new features were added to the mobile application, like defining a new location to retrieve the parking lots and a new user story wasn't created for this functionality we thought that it wasn't worth it. The web application was also finished with success. And the deployment was concluded with terraform in the AWS cloud. The meetings worked well, we managed to do one meeting per week, and in total in this sprint 3 meetings were perform, since this sprint was a bit longer than the others.
