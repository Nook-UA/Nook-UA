## Retrospective

The user stories related to the mobile application were not concluded due to lack of time and some bugs were fixed, like the aspect of the drawer and some bugs that were involved with navigation in the app. There were also some changes in the architecturem cause it was outdated/incorrect. The meetings worked we got together twice a week to discuss the architecture and what was made, what was left and if someone couldn't finish there task/user-story in time.
