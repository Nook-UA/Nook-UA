## Retrospective

The user story for add a new park is developed, however it's missing tests and peer review. The user story to see the close parking spots in the mobile app was not implemented do to lack of time, so it will be moved to the next sprint. Also, and for the same reason, we were unable to meet 3 times a week as we planned, instead we kept the one meeting per week. The user story to configure parking spots was fully implemented, however it lacks integration with the user story add park (client)
