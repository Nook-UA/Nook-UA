## Retrospective

The initial setup was completed with success, the design mockups, static pages and fake endpoints were also finished. 
There wasn't time to develop some tests do to the duration of the sprint, which was only one week, and therefore no ser stories were completed. In our Jira project, instead of using story points we used time tracking, but concluded that it wasn't a very good approach so we plan to change it in the next sprint to story points.
