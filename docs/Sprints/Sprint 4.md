## Retrospective

In this sprint, even though the tasks were divided differently due to implementation issues and time constraints caused by other courses, it was not possible to deliver the user stories. We will keep the same distribution for the next sprint.  

The backend part is almost completely implemented, except for the integration between the two APIs.


## Next Sprint

For the next sprint, we want to complete the unfinished user stories, revamp the client UI, and integrate the two APIs.
To track the work done by each member, we will hold a meeting on both Thursdays and another on Sunday.

## Burndown chart

As no user stories were completed, the burndown chart is empty.
