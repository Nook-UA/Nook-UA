# SCRUM Framework

Inside the agile ideology, we opted for using the SCRUM framework to organize our work. Scrum has proven to be an effective approach for managing complex projects while fostering team collaboration and flexibility. 

This methodology pushed us to deliver a working MVP each sprint, as small as it is. Next we're describing more in detail your SCRUM process:

## Key Elements of Our Scrum Implementation
### Sprints

Our sprints have a duration of **two weeks**. During these time, two team members act as **Scrum master** and as **product owner**. Both the sprint contents as the roles among the team members are discussed by the team in the SPRINT PLANNING, held before a sprint starts.

During the sprint, the team woks toward the sprint goal, trying to develop a solution to deliver at the end of the sprint as a MVP.

### Sprint planning
At the start of each sprint, we meet in **Discord** for the sprint planning session. This meeting involves the following:

- **Setting the Sprint Goal**: A concise objective that guides the sprint's work.

- **Selecting User Stories**: We select together a set of user stories from the product backlog, prioritizing those with the highest business value.

- **Estimating Effort**: Using story points, we assess the complexity and effort required for each user story.

### Sprint Review
At the end of each sprint, we meet again in a sprint review meeting. This meeting involves the following:

- **Demonstrating Completed Work**: Each team member showcases each completed user story or feature, ensuring alignment with the sprint goal.

- **Discussing Next Steps**: The feedback is summarized, and potential directions for future sprints are briefly discussed to ensure transparency and alignment.

The sprint review ensures that stakeholders remain engaged and that the product evolves in line with their expectations and business needs.

### Sprint Retrospective
At the conclusion of each sprint, the team conducts a retrospective meeting. This meeting involves the following:

- **Reviewing the Sprint**: The team reflects on what went well, what could have been better, and what obstacles were encountered.

- **Identifying Actionable Improvements**: Specific actions to improve processes, team dynamics, or technical practices are discussed and agreed upon.

- **Establishing Follow-Up Items**: The team documents and prioritizes the identified actions to ensure they are addressed in subsequent sprints.

The sprint retrospective fosters a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that lessons learned are systematically applied to enhance future performance.

## Processing an user story

As the user story moves through the sprint, it passes through various phases. One of the first things we did was preciselly to define the state of a user story on the kanban board and how this state would change. We ended up with this process line:
