# Definition of Ready and Definition of Done

In Agile and Scrum methodologies, having clear definitions for when a task is "ready" and when it's "done" is crucial for team alignment and productivity. Below are the checklists for both the **Definition of Ready** and the **Definition of Done** used in our projects.

## Definition of Ready

A user story or task is considered **Ready** when it meets the following criteria:

1. **Check all the INVEST requirements**  
   The story must fulfill the INVEST principles:
   - **I**: Independent
   - **N**: Negotiable
   - **V**: Valuable
   - **E**: Estimable
   - **S**: Small
   - **T**: Testable

2. **Acceptance Criteria**  
   Clear and concise acceptance criteria are defined to ensure the feature meets expectations and is verifiable.

3. **Estimated in Story Points**  
   The story or task must be estimated using story points to determine its complexity and size.

4. **Prioritization ranked appropriately in the product backlog**  
   The story is prioritized in the product backlog according to the team's goals and product vision.

## Definition of Done

A user story or task is considered **Done** when the following conditions are met:

1. **Unit Tests written**  
   Whenever changes are made to existing code, unit tests are written to cover new or changed methods.

2. **Developed**  
   The feature or task has been implemented and meets the technical requirements.

3. **Local Tested**  
   The code has been tested locally to verify that it works as expected without introducing bugs.

4. **Pass all the tests**  
   All tests, including unit tests and any automated tests, must pass successfully.

5. **Documented**  
   The feature or task is documented. This includes updating any related documentation and ensuring code comments are included where necessary.

6. **Peer Review**  
   The code must be peer-reviewed by at least one team member to ensure quality and correctness.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that tasks are properly scoped and completed to a high standard, leading to a more predictable and effective delivery process.
